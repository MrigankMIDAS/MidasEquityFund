# MidasEquityFund
DBMS project: A functional (dummy) website for Midas Equity Fund using HTML, CSS for frontend, and PHP for backend. The site has functional pages for client and manager login. The clients can see funds they own with us and place order for new funds. The managers can see which funds are under them, their changes and buy and sell stocks as required.
